"My parents are coming for Christmas, tell me where I am supposed to put them." she sighed. Baa replied " You have four bedrooms, one playroom for your two boys, a conservatory and a reception room, you can easily find space".`

The reception room has a big Christmas tree and the conservatory is where I like to have tea. I'm very unhappy about this visit." the wealthy friend said. She continued to grumble all through Christmas and new year. `

Later they noticed all of her friends' children running back and forward from the gate and the husband ironing outside their tiny house with a coal iron and whistling with a big smile on his face. "Why are you all so happy?" Baa asked. The husband replied "My parents in law are coming for Christmas".`
