    drink. Later they noticed all of her friends' children running back and forward from the gate and the
    husband ironing outside with a coal iron and whistling with a big smile on his face. "Why are you all so
    happy?" Baa asked. The husband replied "My parents in law are coming for Christmas" "But where will they
    stay" Baa asked "your 3 children already all share a room and you have no living room". With a knowing
    smile he said " I have a place for them in my heart, so I will make place in my house and we will all be
    together."`

      Later that week a wealthy friend came to visit Tirveni and her Baa. She looked melancholy.
      "My parents are coming for Christmas, tell me where I am supposed to put them. " she sighed
     Baa replied " You have 4 bedrooms, one playroom for your 2 boys, a conservatory and a reception room, you can find space".
     "No, I can't ask my boys to give up one of their rooms and their playroom can't have less toys.
     The 4th bedroom has lots of things I have collected and it would be a pain to sort them and clear it.
     The reception room has a big Christmas tree and the conservatory is where I like to have tea. I'm most unhappy about this visit." the wealthy friend said
